# :floppy_disk: RESTful Library Management API :books:

## :computer: Tech Used

- Backend Framework: Node.js with Express
- Programming Language: TypeScript
- Database: SQL (Structured Query Language)
- ORM: TypeORM
- API Design: REST Principles
- Validation and Sanitization: Joi Validator
- Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- SOLID Principles: Followed for clean and maintainable code

## :book: Overview

RESTful Library Management API is a backend-only project developed using Node.js and Express, written in TypeScript. The API serves as a centralized system for managing a library's book collection. It adheres to REST principles, providing endpoints to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on book records stored in an SQL database.

## :gear: Functionality

The API includes endpoints to create new book records, retrieve book details, update book information, and delete books. Input data is thoroughly validated and sanitized using the Joi Validator, ensuring the integrity of the database. The API follows the SOLID principles, promoting modular and maintainable codebase.

User authentication is implemented using JSON Web Tokens (JWT), ensuring secure access to the API's functionalities. Meaningful HTTP status codes are returned for different scenarios, making the API user-friendly and informative.
